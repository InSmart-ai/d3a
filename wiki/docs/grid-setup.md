On this page the user can set up the architecture of the grid by adding Areas and Energy Resources. You can define up to 1000 nodes. Each area or energy resource is considered as 1 node.

[Areas](areas.md) are made up of a spot market in which all connected Energy Resources, sub-areas and parent areas trade energy. Areas can potentially house multiple markets of different market types. This feature will be available in the future.



After creating the first area the user has to define a [Market Maker](market-maker.md).


There are 4 different types of basic energy resources available (for detailed settings descriptions follow the individual links):

- [PV](pv.md)
- [Storage](storage.md)
- [Load](load.md)
- [Power Plant](power-plant.md)

The user can also insert [Libraries](libraries.md), which are customized energy resources available from the D3A community. A list of these energy resources with a search function appears when clicking on "LIBRARY" on the upper right corner.

Once ready, the user can to the [Results](results.md) page and run the simulation.

When the simulation is running, the user can : 

![img](img/grid-setup-7.png){:style="height:40px;width:100px"} Pause it

![img](img/grid-setup-8.png){:style="height:40px;width:100px"} Abort it (Warning, after aborting the user will not be able to resume the simulation!)

The user can duplicate the number of Areas or Energy Resources by clicking on the +/- buttons shown below (energy resource or area settings view).
