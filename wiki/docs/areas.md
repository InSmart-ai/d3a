Areas contain sub-areas and energy resources. Areas are interconnected by inter-area agents in a hierarchical network. Each area has a market on which inter-area agents (representing other markets) and energy resources can post bids and offers. For further information about the markets, see the backend manual: [Markets](markets.md).
